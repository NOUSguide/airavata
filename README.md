Airavata is a mythological white elephant who carries the Hindu god Indra.
Airavata has four tusks and seven trunks and is spotless white.
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airavata))

Django Airavata is a Django 1.8+ library that allows you to hosts multiple
dynamic sites running on a single Django instance/db.

I have been using a customized version of
[dynamicsites](https://bitbucket.org/uysrc/django-dynamicsites/overview) for a
while now. But with the new features from Django 1.7 and 1.8, there exists
another simpler, and more pythonesque IMHO, way to achieve the same results.
Airavata is an attempt at that *other* way.
